# TowaChallenge
Internship Coding Challenge:
A small application built with Vue.js and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Node.js and Git installed on your system. 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. (Or sudo npm install.) Should you come across dependency issues with eslint know that this is a known problem with the newest npm version which I have used in this project and it can safely be used with npm install -legacy-peer-deps)
3. Run `npm run serve` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the app.

## Dependencies

- Vue.js
