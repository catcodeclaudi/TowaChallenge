    <h2>About this Project</h2>
      <p>
      This project is part of my interviewing process for an internship at TOWA - The Digital Growth Company.
      Working with Vue.js and Bootstrap has been entirely new to me, what a journey.
      This has been really fun and I have learned loads. Now I can't wait to dive deeper and also explore other tools.<br>
      I will still work on this project to improve my code, and implement some other features.<br>
